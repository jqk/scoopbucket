## Scoop bucket

This is a [Scoop](http://scoop.sh/) [bucket](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop/wiki/Buckets), which contains nonportable application.

[Scoop](http://scoop.sh/) is an excellent package manager for Windows. It allows installing, uninstalling and updating apps from the command line. The [Scoop repository](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) contains many useful applications and there are many more in the [extras bucket](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras). A bucket is a collection of application manifests, while an app manifest is a recipe for installing software.
